== Introduction

Service Foundry provides automated tools to create and manage Kubernetes resources required for a certain applications using Kustomize, Helm, and Terraform in the way of Turnkey solution.


A single configuration file is used to generate the Kubernetes resources required for a certain application. The configuration file is a YAML file that contains the information about the application, such as the name of the application, the version of the application, and the configuration of the application.

Service Foundry provides a set of tools to automate this process with one single configuration file.

=== Prerequisites

As Service Foundry is a set of tools to create and manage Kubernetes resources, you need to have the following tools installed on your local machine:

* Kubernetes cluster (EKS or AKS)
* kubectl
* Helm
* Docker(optional)
* Terraform(optional)
* jq
* yq


== Working with Service Foundry on your local machine

One of the main components is the generator-nsa2, which is a Yeoman generator that generates the configuration file and all supporting files required for installing applications on Kubernetes. Node.js and npm are required to install the Yeoman generator.

* Install the latest Node.js LTS version
* Install Yeoman

=== Install Node.js and npm

To install Node.js and npm, you can use Homebrew on macOS. If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can install it by running the following command:

[,terminal]
----
$ brew install node
$ node -v
$ npm -v
----

=== Install Yeoman

Install Yeoman globally using npm. Yeoman is a scaffolding tool for modern web applications. It provides a generator ecosystem that allows you to create and manage projects easily.

[,terminal]
----
$ npm install -g yo
----

== Getting generator-nsa2 from GitHub

[NOTE]
====
As of writing this documentation, the generator-nsa2 is a private repository. Contact link:https://nsalexamy.github.io/service-foundry/pages/developers/young-kim/[the author] to get access to the repository.
====

[,terminal]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:nsalexamy/generator-nsa2.git
$ cd generator-nsa2

$ npm install
$ npm link
----

== Create a new project for Infrastructure Foundry

Infrastructure Foundry is a set of tools to create and manage the infrastructure for your application. It includes tools to create and manage Kubernetes clusters, Helm charts, and Docker images.

[,terminal]
----
# create working directory and go to it
$ mkdir nsa2-foundry && cd nsa2-foundry

$ yo nsa2:infra-foundry init
$ yo nsa2:infra-foundry generate
$ yo nsa2:infra-foundry deploy
----

By default, it will install the following tools:

* cert-manager
* Keycloak
* Traefik
* Prometheus Operator
* OpenTelemetry Operator

== Service Foundry Submodules

Apart from infra-foundry, Service Foundry has several submodules that can be used to create and manage Kubernetes resources for a certain application. The submodules are:

* infra-foundry
* o11y-foundry
* sso-foundry
* backend-foundry
* bigdata-foundry

For more information about each submodule, please refer to the documentation of each submodule.
