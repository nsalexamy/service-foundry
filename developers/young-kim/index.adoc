// [quote, About Me, Young Gyu Kim]
// ____
// In my previous role at a fast-paced startup providing EMR solutions, I took on multiple responsibilities, including Solution Architect, Senior Backend Developer, Big Data Engineer, Observability Engineer, and Kubernetes Application Developer.
//
// As a Solution Architect and Senior Java Developer, I design architectures to modernize EMR applications and lead the development of healthcare solutions. My responsibilities include writing architecture documents, providing technical guidance, ensuring high-quality code, and establishing standardized development processes for the team.
//
// As a Data Engineer, I design and implement data pipelines for healthcare analytics using Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, Apache Airflow, Neo4j, DuckDB, and Sling on Kubernetes.
//
// Driven by curiosity and a passion for innovation, I have also taken the initiative to develop a suite of tools and services for building and managing cloud-native applications. In parallel, I actively share technical insights through LinkedIn articles, exploring modern software architectures and best practices in observability, scalability, resilience, and security.
