== What represents an Internal Developer Platform (IDP)?

Imagine a professional restaurant kitchen. 

* **The Chefs (Developers)** focus on cooking (coding) amazing dishes. They don't build the stoves, wire the electricity, or source the raw ingredients from the farm every single time they want to cook. 
* **The Kitchen Station (IDP)** provides them with everything they need: pre-heated ovens, chopped ingredients, sharp knives, and clean plates—all within arm's reach.

An **Internal Developer Platform (IDP)** is that "Kitchen Station" for software engineers. It is a self-service platform that gives developers everything they need to build, deploy, and run applications without having to worry about the underlying "plumbing" (Kubernetes, cloud infrastructure, networking, security).

=== Why do you need an IDP?

Without an IDP, developers spend too much time on "TicketOps"—waiting for other teams to provision databases, open firewall ports, or grant permissions. An IDP removes these bottlenecks.

* **Self-Service:** Developers get what they need immediately.
* **Golden Paths:** The "right way" to do things is also the easiest way.
* **Cognitive Load Reduction:** Developers focus on business logic, not YAML files.

== How Service Foundry aligns with IDP

Service Foundry is a complete, opinionated IDP implementation. It maps directly to the canonical IDP model, providing all the necessary layers out of the box.

|===
| IDP Component | Implementation in Service Foundry | Benefit

| **Developer Interface**
| **Service Foundry Console**
| A unified web UI where developers can view services, environments, and deployments without touching `kubectl`.

| **Golden Paths**
| **Service Templates**
| Pre-configured templates for standard microservices (Go, Java, Node.js) with generic Helm charts that handle all Kubernetes complexity.

| **GitOps Engine**
| **ArgoCD**
| Automated delivery pipeline where Git commits are the only source of truth. No manual deployments.

| **Infrastructure Layer**
| **Terraform & Crossplane**
| Abstracts AWS resources (RDS, Redis, IAM) so developers just request a "Database" and get a production-ready instance.

| **Security & Identity**
| **Keycloak, OAuth2 Proxy, Sealed Secrets**
| Enterprise-grade security is baked in. SSO, RBAC, and secret encryption are handled automatically, not as an afterthought.

| **Observability**
| **OTel, Prometheus, Grafana, Loki**
| Monitoring is automatic. Every service gets logs, metrics, and traces without the developer writing extra configuration.

== The Service Foundry Philosophy

Service Foundry is designed to bridge the gap between **Flexibility** and **Standardization**.

1.  **Curated, Not Restricted:** We provide a "Curated Stack" of the best open-source tools (Argo, Prometheus, Keycloak). You can swap them if you want, but you don't have to waste time choosing them.
2.  **GitOps at the Core:** Everything is code. The UI is just a window into your Git repository. This ensures auditability and easy rollbacks.
3.  **Day 2 Operations Ready:** It's not just about deploying. It's about operating—observing, scaling, and securing applications in the long run.

== Next Steps

Now that you understand what an IDP is and how Service Foundry fulfills that role, you can start building your platform.
