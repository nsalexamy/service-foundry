== What is Service Foundry?

Service Foundry is an internal developer platform (IDP) that provides a self-service GitOps console for teams to provision, deploy, secure, and observe workloads on Kubernetes in just 10 minutes.

Service Foundry is a *Curated Stack* of enterprise-grade open-source tools combined with a *UI-driven GitOps console* that enables teams to provision, deploy, secure, and observe workloads on Kubernetes in just 10 minutes.

As a self-service platform engineering solution, Service Foundry eliminates the complexity of assembling and integrating multiple tools by providing a pre-configured, production-ready GitOps platform. No proprietary subscriptions or additional tools are required—everything runs on your own Kubernetes cluster using battle-tested open-source components.

Service Foundry integrates popular open-source tools into a cohesive automation system, enabling you to:

* *Use standardized GitOps patterns* to manage infrastructure and application workloads declaratively
* *Collaborate effectively* through version-controlled configuration stored in Git
* *Deploy complete application stacks* including observability, identity management, and data pipelines
* *Secure resources* using enterprise-grade Single Sign-On (SSO) and encrypted secrets management
* *Accelerate deployment* with a curated Application Catalog of ready-to-use open-source applications

It bridges the gap between developers and operations by providing an intuitive UI-driven console while preserving the auditable, declarative nature of Git-based infrastructure as code.




== Key Features

Service Foundry provides enterprise-grade capabilities out of the box:

* *Auditable Infrastructure as Code:* All configuration changes are tracked in Git, providing full audit trails and rollback capabilities
* *Standardized GitOps Patterns:* Implement industry best practices for continuous deployment and infrastructure management
* *Version-Controlled Configuration:* Manage all platform and application configurations through Git workflows
* *Complete Application Stacks:* Deploy entire technology stacks (observability, identity, data pipelines) with pre-configured integrations
* *Enterprise Security:* Built-in Single Sign-On (SSO) and encrypted secrets management using Keycloak and Sealed Secrets
* *Automated Certificate Management:* Automatic TLS certificate provisioning and renewal via cert-manager

== Main Components

Service Foundry is built on a curated stack of proven open-source tools, carefully integrated to work seamlessly together.

=== Core Components

The core platform includes essential infrastructure and GitOps components:

* *ArgoCD:* GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes, providing declarative application deployment and lifecycle management
* *Argo Rollouts:* Advanced deployment strategies including blue-green, canary, and progressive delivery with automated rollbacks
* *Traefik:* Modern cloud-native ingress controller with Gateway API support for routing external traffic to services
* *Keycloak:* Enterprise-grade Identity and Access Management (IAM) for centralized authentication and authorization
* *OAuth2 Proxy:* Secure Single Sign-On (SSO) integration layer that protects applications with authentication
* *Sealed Secrets:* Encrypted secrets management allowing safe storage of sensitive data in Git repositories
* *Cert-manager:* Automated TLS certificate provisioning and renewal from Let's Encrypt and other certificate authorities
* *PostgreSQL:* Relational database for platform data storage and application backends
* *Redis:* In-memory data store for user session management and application caching

The platform also includes two custom-built applications:

* *Service Foundry Builder:* GitOps resource generator that creates and updates Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts
* *Service Foundry Console:* UI-driven GitOps console providing visual management of applications, deployments, and platform configurations

=== Observability Components

The observability stack is optional but highly recommended for production environments. All observability components can be easily installed through the Service Foundry Console UI.

* *OpenTelemetry:* Vendor-neutral observability framework for collecting traces, metrics, and logs
* *Prometheus:* Industry-standard metrics collection, storage, and alerting system
* *Grafana:* Feature-rich observability dashboard for visualizing metrics, logs, and traces
* *Jaeger:* Distributed tracing system for monitoring and troubleshooting microservices
* *OpenSearch:* Scalable search and analytics engine for storing and querying observability data
* *Fluent Bit:* Lightweight and efficient log collection and forwarding agent
* *Loki:* Horizontally scalable log aggregation system designed for cloud-native environments
* *Tempo:* Cost-effective distributed tracing backend with seamless Grafana integration

== What You Need to Run Service Foundry

Service Foundry has minimal requirements and can be deployed in just 10 minutes with the following prerequisites:

=== Infrastructure Requirements

* *A Kubernetes Cluster:* AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
** *Supported Platform:* This version of Service Foundry has been tested and is currently supported only on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using EKS
** *Kubernetes Version:* v1.24 or higher
** *Future Support:* Additional cloud providers (GKE, AKS) and self-managed Kubernetes distributions will be supported in future releases
* *A Git Repository:* A Git repository for storing GitOps configurations (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or any Git provider)

=== Bootstrap Process

The Service Foundry Bootstrap tool automates the entire installation process:

1. *Initial Setup:* Installs ArgoCD as the GitOps engine on your Kubernetes cluster
2. *Core Component Deployment:* Uses ArgoCD to deploy all core components from your GitOps repository
3. *GitOps Configuration:* Creates the necessary repository structure and manifests for managing your platform
4. *Console Activation:* Deploys the Service Foundry Console UI for managing applications and configurations

All core components are version-controlled in the GitOps repository, allowing you to:

* Track all changes through Git commit history
* Review and approve infrastructure changes via pull requests
* Update components using standard GitOps workflows
* Roll back to previous configurations when needed
* Maintain consistency across multiple environments

== Who is Service Foundry For?

Service Foundry is designed for teams and organizations looking to adopt GitOps practices on Kubernetes without the overhead of assembling and integrating multiple tools.

=== Ideal Use Cases

* *Platform Engineering Teams:* Build internal developer platforms with standardized workflows and self-service capabilities

* *Startups and Scale-ups:* Establish production-grade infrastructure quickly without dedicating extensive resources to platform development

* *Educational Institutions:* Provide students and researchers with a complete, enterprise-grade technology stack for learning modern DevOps practices, including GitOps, observability, security, and data engineering

* *Innovation and PoC Teams:* Rapidly prototype and validate new technologies on Kubernetes with pre-configured, production-ready components

* *Enterprise Development Teams:* Standardize application deployment pipelines and infrastructure management across multiple teams and projects

* *DevOps Practitioners:* Implement GitOps best practices with proven patterns and tools without starting from scratch

== Best Practices

To maximize the value of Service Foundry, we recommend the following practices:

* *Version Control Everything:* Store all configuration for platform components and enterprise applications in Git repositories with proper version control

* *Implement Automated Promotion Pipelines:* Establish progressive delivery workflows across environments (PR → Development → Staging → Production) with automated testing gates

* *Enforce Authentication:* Use SSO (Single Sign-On) for all platform and application access to maintain centralized identity management

* *Secure Sensitive Data:* Store all secrets using Sealed Secrets or external secret managers, never committing plain-text credentials to Git

* *Use Gateway API:* Leverage Traefik's Gateway API implementation for standardized, secure external access to services

* *Enable Observability:* Deploy the observability stack in all non-development environments to maintain visibility into system health and performance

* *Regular Updates:* Keep platform components updated through GitOps workflows, testing updates in lower environments before production

* *Document Custom Configurations:* Maintain documentation for any customizations or extensions to Service Foundry profiles in your GitOps repository
