== Introduction


== Prove Domain Ownership

Go ACM ( AWS Certificate Manager ) requires you to prove ownership of your domain before it can issue a TLS/SSL certificate for it. One common method to prove domain ownership is by adding specific DNS records to your domain's DNS settings.

=== How to Prove Domain Ownership

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the ACM service.
2. Request a public certificate for your domain (e.g., example.com and *.example.com).
3. During the certificate request process, choose the DNS validation method.
4. ACM will provide you with CNAME records that you need to add to your domain's DNS settings.
5. Go to your DNS provider (e.g., Route 53, Go Daddy) and add the provided CNAME records.
6. After adding the DNS records, return to ACM and click "Continue" to complete the validation process.
7. ACM will periodically check for the presence of the DNS records. Once it verifies the records, your certificate will be issued.

* Domain: *.servicefoundry.ca
* Type: CNAME
* Name: _xxxx.servicefoundry.ca
* Value: _yyyy.acm-validations.aws.

=== Update Name Servers in Your Domain Registrar

Navigate to your domain registrar's website (e.g., Go Daddy, Namecheap) and update the nameservers to the ones provided by Route 53.
