title: Automating Kubernetes Provisioning and GitOps Workflows with Service Foundry
summary: "In this article, I share our experience building a GitOps-based Kubernetes provisioning workflow using Service Foundry and Argo CD. We designed a layered module architecture where core components like Argo CD and Sealed Secrets are provisioned first, followed by infrastructure services and domain-specific workloads. This structure allows for reusable configurations, secure secret management, and automated deployment through Git. By combining Helm, Kustomize, and GitOps principles, Service Foundry enables a scalable and maintainable approach to managing cloud-native environments."

== Overview

This document highlights our team’s experience in automating Kubernetes workload provisioning and enabling GitOps workflows using Argo CD and Service Foundry. It explains how we set up a secure, repeatable deployment pipeline using Argo CD, managed sensitive data through Sealed Secrets, and integrated everything into a modular platform architecture.

== Software Requirements

Service Foundry acts as a provisioning tool for Kubernetes, generating Helm-based YAML manifests and helper scripts for deploying platform and application resources. Previously, these generated YAML files were created and stored only within the container during deployment, making them hard to track or maintain.

To improve visibility and maintainability, we adopted Argo CD to manage these manifests as code. By committing them to a Git repository, we enabled change tracking, version control, and history across our deployments.

== Enhancements

We’ve introduced several improvements to the Service Foundry builder environment to better support GitOps workflows and secure operations:

* Integration with Argo CD for GitOps-based deployment management.
* Use of Sealed Secrets to securely store sensitive data in Git.
* Automated generation and deployment of Argo CD applications and Kubernetes manifests.
* Streamlined end-to-end GitOps pipeline through Service Foundry.

== Layered Architecture and Module Dependencies in Service Foundry

Service Foundry is designed with a layered modular architecture that allows for reusable, scalable, and consistent provisioning across environments. Each module encapsulates a specific layer of the platform stack and declares its dependencies explicitly, enabling hierarchical composition and separation of concerns.

=== Argo Foundry (Top Layer)

At the top of the hierarchy is the argo-foundry module. It sets the foundation for GitOps by installing:

* *Argo CD* – for declarative application delivery and lifecycle management.
* *Sealed Secrets* – for secure management of secrets stored in Git.

This module can be deployed independently and is required by all other modules in order to support GitOps workflows and secret encryption.

[NOTE]
====
Since Argo CD manages other applications, it cannot manage itself through GitOps.
====

=== Infra Foundry

The infra-foundry module depends on argo-foundry and provides core platform services:

* *cert-manager*: for certificate automation.
* **prometheus-operato**r: for managing Prometheus, Alertmanager, and related resources.
* **otel-operato**r: for collecting telemetry data via OpenTelemetry.
* *traefik*: for ingress and routing.
* *keycloak*: for identity and access management.
* *spark-operator*: for distributed data processing workloads.

Components defined in argo-foundry are implicitly available in infra-foundry.

=== Domain-Specific Foundries

Modules in this layer depend on infra-foundry (and transitively on argo-foundry):

* *o11y-foundry*: deploys observability tools like Loki, Grafana, and Jaeger.
* *bigdata-foundry*: provisions data platforms such as Spark, Kafka, and Airflow.
* *backend-foundry*: sets up application runtimes, API gateways, and service configurations.

Each module builds on its upstream dependencies and introduces features specific to its domain.

== The argo-foundry Module

The argo-foundry module is responsible for provisioning Argo CD and Sealed Secrets. It follows a four-phase process:

* *init*: generates argo-foundry-config.yaml file
* *generate*: creates Kubernetes manifests.
* *build*:  commits manifests to Git.
* *deploy*: installs Argo CD and its initial applications (e.g., Sealed Secrets).

=== argo-foundry-config.yaml

This configuration file defines how Argo CD and Sealed Secrets should be deployed.

<1> This section configures Argo CD, including the repository URL, project name, and GitOps settings. It also specifies the SSH key to be used for accessing the Git repository.
<2> This section configures Sealed Secrets, including the namespace and version to be used.

Service Foundry uses this configuration file to generate the necessary YAML files for deploying Argo CD and Sealed Secrets.

=== custom-values.yaml for Argo CD Helm Chart

This custom values file configures Argo CD for GitOps, including SSH credentials and Git repository access.

----

This custom values file is used to configure the Argo CD Helm chart. It includes settings for SSH credentials, repository configuration, and server settings. The SSH private key is provided in a secure manner, allowing Argo CD to access the Git repository.

=== Argo CD Project Configuration

The following manifest defines the Argo CD project for managing Service Foundry:

.argocd-app-project.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: AppProject
metadata:
  name: service-foundry
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  description: Argo CD project using SSH-based Git repo

  # Important: use the SSH-formatted Git URL
  sourceRepos:
    - git@github.com:nsalexamy/service-foundry-argocd.git

  destinations:
    - namespace: '*'
      server: https://kubernetes.default.svc

  clusterResourceWhitelist:
    - group: '*'
      kind: '*'

  namespaceResourceWhitelist:
    - group: '*'
      kind: '*'
----

These manifest files are used to install Argo CD and then create the Argo CD project for the Service Foundry GitOps repository. The project is configured to allow access to the specified Git repository and Kubernetes cluster resources.

=== deploy-argocd.sh

This script installs Argo CD and waits for the server to be ready before applying post-deployment resources.

.deploy-argocd.sh
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash

WAIT_SPENT=0

echo "Waiting for argocd to be ready for maximum ${WAIT_TIMEOUT} seconds..."

while ! kubectl -n "argocd" wait --for=condition=Ready pod -l sf-component=argocd.server --timeout=${WAIT_TIMEOUT}s ; do
    echo "Waiting for argocd to be created..."
    sleep $WAIT_INTERVAL

    WAIT_SPENT=$((WAIT_SPENT + WAIT_INTERVAL))

    if [ $WAIT_SPENT -ge $WAIT_TIMEOUT ]; then
        echo "Timeout waiting for Argocd to be ready after ${WAIT_TIMEOUT}s"
        exit 1
    fi
done

kubectl apply -k k8s/argocd/post/

== Build Phase: Sealing Secrets and GitOps Commit

The build phase of Service Foundry applies Sealed Secrets and pushes manifests to Git. This phase occurs after generate and before deploy.

=== Pushing to Git

The push-argocd-apps.sh script commits the sealed and generated manifests to the GitOps repository.

== Summary: GitOps-Based Automation Workflow

The end-to-end provisioning process using Service Foundry and Argo CD includes:

1. **Generate Manifest Files**: The Service Foundry generator creates the necessary manifest files for each module.
2. **Seal Secrets**: Encrypt all sensitive data before committing to Git.
3. **Push to Git**: Store manifests in GitOps repo for version tracking.
4. **Deploy via Argo CD**: Let Argo CD apply and manage the desired state continuously.

== Conclusion

By adopting Service Foundry with Argo CD, we’ve established a modular and secure GitOps platform for Kubernetes. The layered architecture simplifies reuse, while Sealed Secrets ensures security. This approach streamlines application delivery, enhances traceability, and supports scalable, cloud-native infrastructure management.
