= Hello Service Operator Implementation Plans

== Introduction

This document outlines the implementation plans for the Hello Service Operator, a Kubernetes operator that manages Hello Service resources.

== Goal

A CR creates:

- Deployment
- Service
- ConfigMap
- HTTPRoute

== CRD: HelloApp 

- spec
  - image: string
  - port: int
  - replicas: int
  - message: string
  - host
- status
  - ready: bool
  - availableReplicas: int

== Reconcile behavior:

- Ensure Deployment exists with desired image/replicas
- Ensure Service exists
- If host set, ensure HTTPRoute exists
