== Introduction

Service Foundry Console is a web-based interface designed to simplify the management of Kubernetes resources and GitOps workflows. It provides an intuitive way to visualize, manage, and deploy applications in a Kubernetes environment, enhancing productivity and collaboration among development teams.

Service Foundry Console is the dedicated user interface for the Service Foundry Builder environment, which is a comprehensive platform for building, deploying, and managing applications in a cloud-native way. It integrates seamlessly with various submodules such as infrastructure management, observability, and single sign-on, providing a unified experience for developers and operators.

Service Foundry Console is built on top of the Service Foundry Builder environment, which includes various submodules for infrastructure management, git-ops, observability, single sign-on, and more.

== Architecture Overview

The architecture of Service Foundry Console is designed to provide a seamless user experience while managing Kubernetes resources and GitOps workflows. It consists of the following key components:

* **Frontend**: A web-based interface built with React.js that allows users to interact with Kubernetes clusters and Git repositories. It provides features for provisioning, managing, and deploying applications, as well as visualizing the state of resources.
* **Backend**: A RESTful API that interacts with Kubernetes clusters and Git repositories, handling requests from the frontend and performing necessary operations. This module is written in Go and provides endpoints for managing resources, triggering deployments, and retrieving status information.

== Bootstrapping GitOps with Service Foundry Builder

Bootstrap command of Service Foundry Builder is designed to set up the initial configuration for GitOps workflows. It automates the creation of necessary resources and configurations in Kubernetes, enabling a smooth start for managing applications using GitOps principles.
The bootstrap command performs the following tasks:

* Installs Argo CD and configures it for managing Kubernetes resources.
* Installs Sealed Secrets controller and CLI for secure management of sensitive data.
* Installs Keycloak for single sign-on and identity management and configures it for integration with Kubernetes.
* Installs Traefik as the middleware for routing and load balancing traffic to applications and Single Sign-On (SSO) services.
* Installs Service Foundry Console for managing Kubernetes resources and GitOps workflows.
* Install Service Foundry Console Backend for managing the backend services and providing APIs for the frontend.

=== Prerequisites

* Git Repository: A Git repository to store the configuration files and manage the GitOps workflows.
* Kubernetes Cluster: A running Kubernetes cluster where the Service Foundry Builder environment will be deployed.

=== Environment Variables

Before running the bootstrap command, set the following environment variables:

* *GIT_OPS_REPO_URL*: The URL of the Git repository where the configuration files will be stored.
* *GIT_OPS_REPO_NAME*: The name of the Git repository to use for the GitOps workflows."
* *GIT_OPS_REPO_BRANCH*: main
* *ARGOCD_PROJECT*: The name of the Argo CD project to use for managing the resources.
* *SF_ROOT_DOMAIN*: The root domain for the Service Foundry Console and other services. This domain will be used for single sign-on and routing traffic to applications.
* *AWS_REGION*: The AWS region where the Kubernetes cluster is running.
* *EKS_CLUSTER_NAME*: The name of the EKS cluster where the Service Foundry Builder environment will be deployed.
