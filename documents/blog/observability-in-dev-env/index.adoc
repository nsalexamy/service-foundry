== Introduction

This guide outlines how to set up observability in development environments using *Observability Foundry*—a lightweight, Kubernetes-native observability platform. Built as part of the Service Foundry ecosystem, it enables developers to deploy essential monitoring tools—including metrics, logs, and traces—on their own Kubernetes clusters with support for cloud-native storage.

Optimized for resource efficiency, the development deployment profile is ideal for local clusters and low-cost cloud setups, offering full-stack observability without the complexity of production systems.

=== What’s New in This Release

We’re excited to announce a new version of Observability Foundry, bringing several key updates and enhancements:

* **OpenTelemetry Operator**: Upgraded to version 0.127.0 of opentelemetry-collector-contrib, offering improved compatibility and stability.
* **Grafana**: Updated to version 12.0.1, which introduces enhanced visualization features and more powerful alerting capabilities.
* **LGTM Stack**: Now includes native support for Loki, Grafana, Tempo, and Mimir, enabling a fully integrated observability pipeline.
* *Kubelet cAdvisor Collector*: Improved metrics collection for Kubernetes nodes, offering deeper visibility into container resource usage.

=== Deployment Profiles of Observability Foundry

The Observability Foundry supports multiple deployment profiles tailored for specific environments:

.Deployment Profiles of Observability Foundry
[.img-wide]
image::sf-deployment-profiles.png[]


* *Development*: A resource-efficient configuration for local or cloud-based development environments. Provides metrics, logs, and traces with minimal overhead.
* *Staging*: A pre-production configuration that mirrors production settings, allowing feature validation and integration testing.
* *Production*: A highly available, scalable deployment profile designed to handle large volumes of telemetry with advanced features such as long-term retention, alerting, and custom dashboards.

== Core Components in Development Profile

The development deployment of Observability Foundry includes the following components:


* *OpenTelemetry Collector* (2 replicas): Collects and exports telemetry data.
* *Kubelet cAdvisor Collector* (1 replica): Collects Kubernetes container metrics.
* *Grafana* (1 replica): Visualization layer for logs, metrics, and traces.
* *Prometheus* (1 replica): Time-series metrics store. (Storage: Filesystem)
* *Tempo* (2 replicas): Distributed tracing backend. (Storage: S3)
* *Loki* (2 replicas): Log aggregation system. (Storage: S3)
* *OpenTelementry Spring Application* (2 replicas): Spring Boot application instrumented with OpenTelemetry for backend observability.
* *OpenTelemetry React Application* (1 replica): React application instrumented with OpenTelemetry for frontend observability.
* *Keycloak* (1 replica): Provides Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities for secure access to the observability tools.
* *Keycloak Postgres* (1 replica): Provides OIDC-based authentication and SSO.
* *Traefik* (1 replica): Ingress controller routing traffic to observability services.


=== Namespaces

The deployment utilizes the following Kubernetes namespaces:

* *cert-manager*: TLS certificate management
* *default*: Core components like Prometheus Operator
* *keycloak*: Keycloak authentication server
* *o11y*: Observability components (Grafana, Loki, etc.)

=== Explore Traces and Logs in one Place

The Grafana Explore feature allows users to search and analyze both traces and logs in a unified interface. This makes it easier to correlate events and troubleshoot issues across different telemetry data types.

== Authentication with Keycloak

Keycloak is integrated as the identity provider for secure access. It includes:

* OIDC Server
* Predefined OAuth2 Clients
* Users, roles, and groups for access control
