== Overview

This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough on integrating *Grafana* with *Jaeger* to visualize and monitor distributed traces. It covers:


 * Establishing a connection to Jaeger from Grafana
 * Exploring trace data within Grafana
 * Building custom dashboards for trace visualization

== Benefits of Integrating Jaeger with Grafana

 * Unified Trace Visualization: Grafana offers a centralized interface to visualize Jaeger traces, enabling deeper insights into distributed systems.
 * No Need for Jaeger UI: Access trace data directly in Grafana, eliminating the need to expose the Jaeger UI via Ingress or configure SSO for Jaeger.
 * Customizable Dashboards: Create dashboards tailored to your application’s tracing needs.
 * Proactive Monitoring: Leverage Grafana’s alerting system to generate alerts based on trace metrics.

== Step 1: Connect Grafana to Jaeger

. In Grafana, go to Connections > Add new connection
. Search for and select Jaeger as the data source
. Click Add new data source
. Provide the following details:
  * Name: o11y-jaeger
  * URL: http://jaeger-collector:16686
. Click Save & Test to validate the connection

== Step 2: Create a Dashboard for Trace Visualization

. Navigate to Dashboards and Click 'New > New dashboard'
. Click 'Add visualization'
. Select 'o11y-jaeger' as the data source
. Choose 'Search' for the query type and select 'otel-spring-example' or your own application as the service.
. Input 'otel-spring-example traces' for Title
. Click 'Save dashboard' and provide a name for the dashboard for example 'Traces - Java applications' and click 'Save'

== Step 3: Explore Traces in Grafana

. Go to *Data sources*
. Click *Explore* next to the o11y-jaeger data source
. Select *Search* as the query type
. Choose your application (e.g., otel-spring-example) as the service
. Set *Min Duration* to filter traces, for example, 3.0s for traces longer than 3 seconds
. Click *Run query* to display matching traces

== Conclusion

Integrating Jaeger with Grafana enables comprehensive trace visualization without additional UI or authentication overhead. This integration provides a seamless observability experience by centralizing trace data within Grafana, enhancing the ability to monitor, diagnose, and optimize distributed applications.
