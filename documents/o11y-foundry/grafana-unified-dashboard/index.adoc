title: Building a Unified Observability Dashboard with Grafana
summary: "In this article, I share how to build a unified observability dashboard using Grafana by integrating three key telemetry sources: Prometheus for metrics, Jaeger for traces, and OpenSearch for logs. With a single dashboard, you gain real-time insights into system health, request flows, and log events—all from one place. The guide covers everything from Helm-based provisioning of data sources and dashboards to configuring alerting rules and exploring telemetry interactively. This centralized approach simplifies operations, improves troubleshooting, and enables proactive monitoring for cloud-native applications."

== Introduction

This guide provides a detailed walkthrough on creating a *unified observability dashboard* in *Grafana*. By integrating multiple data sources—*Prometheus* for metrics, *Jaeger* for distributed tracing, and *OpenSearch* for centralized logging—Grafana becomes a single pane of glass for monitoring your entire application landscape.

The dashboard enables real-time visibility across logs, metrics, and traces, allowing for faster diagnostics and streamlined operational workflows.

== Unified Grafana Dashboard Overview

The unified dashboard brings together various observability signals through dedicated panels:


* **Metrics Panel**: Real-time application and system metrics from Prometheus (e.g., JVM memory usage, CPU).
* **Traces Panel**: Distributed tracing data visualized from Jaeger.
* **Logs Panel**: Application logs searchable via OpenSearch and visualized in Grafana.


=== Key Benefits

A unified Grafana dashboard provides several advantages:

* **Centralized Observability**: One dashboard to monitor logs, metrics, and traces.
* **Improved Incident Response**: Easier root cause analysis by correlating signals in one view.
* **Customizable and Extensible**: Easily tailored to your operational needs.
* **Team Collaboration**: Shared dashboards promote team visibility and operational alignment.


== Grafana Configuration

Service Foundry for Observability automates Grafana setup using pre-configured Helm values that include:

* Data source provisioning for Prometheus, Jaeger, and OpenSearch
* A unified dashboard integrating all three sources
* Alerting rules for JVM and trace-based metrics

[NOTE]
====
All configurations are managed via the grafana-values.yaml file used in Helm deployment.
====

=== Data Source Configuration

.grafana-values.yaml - data sources
[source,yaml]
----
datasources:
  datasources.yaml:
    apiVersion: 1
    datasources:
    ## <1>
    - name: <%= namespace %>-prometheus
      type: prometheus
      url: http://prometheus:9090
      uid: prometheus
      # Access mode - proxy (server in the UI) or direct (browser in the UI).
      access: proxy
      isDefault: true
    ## <2>

      type: jaeger
      url: http://jaeger-collector:16686
      uid: jaeger

    ## <3>
    - name: <%= namespace %>-opensearch

        logMessageField: "body"
        logLevelField: "severityText"

        tlsCACert: |
          -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

          -----END CERTIFICATE-----

----
<1> Add Prometheus as a data source for metrics collection.
<2> Add Jaeger as a data source for distributed tracing.
<3> Add OpenSearch as a data source for centralized logging.

Service Foundry for Observability automatically provisions these data sources during the Grafana deployment using Helm. The `grafana-values.yaml` file contains the necessary configurations to set up these data sources.

The screenshot below shows the Grafana UI with the provisioned data sources.

=== Unified Dashboard Provisioning

Set up dashboard providers and load dashboards via ConfigMaps:


.grafana-values.yaml - dashboardProviders
[source,yaml]
----
dashboardProviders:
  dashboardproviders.yaml:
    apiVersion: 1
    providers:
      - name: default
        orgId: 1
        folder: ''
        type: file
        disableDeletion: false
        editable: true
        options:
          path: /var/lib/grafana/dashboards/default
----

==== ConfigMap for Dashboards

To load the unified dashboard into Grafana, you need to create a ConfigMap that contains the dashboard JSON file. This ConfigMap will be referenced in the `grafana-values.yaml` file.


* jvm-memory-dashboard.json - JVM Memory Dashboard
* traces-java-applications.json - Traces Dashboard
* traces-to-metrics.json - Metrics converted from Traces

.grafana-values.yaml - dashboardsConfigMaps
[source,yaml]
----
dashboardsConfigMaps:
  default: grafana-default-dashboards
----

The screenshot below shows the unified dashboard that combines metrics, traces, and logs from Prometheus, Jaeger, and OpenSearch.

=== Configuring Alerts

Alerts are managed directly in grafana-values.yaml since ConfigMaps are not supported for alert provisioning.

==== Contact Points (e.g., Email)

Contact points are used to define how Grafana sends alerts. You can configure contact points such as email, Slack, or other notification channels.

.grafana-values.yaml - contactPoints
[source,yaml]
----
alerting:
  contactpoints.yaml:
    apiVersion: 1
    contactPoints:
      - orgId: 1
        name: service-operators
        receivers:
          - uid: cen4b1ckf03cwb
            type: email
            settings:
              addresses: your-email@example.com
              singleEmail: false
            disableResolveMessage: false
----

The screenshot below shows the Grafana UI where you can configure contact points for alert notifications.

==== Alerting Rules

Alert rules can be defined in the 'rules.yaml' section of the `grafana-values.yaml` file. These rules specify the conditions under which alerts are triggered.

Since the contents of the alerting rules can be quite extensive, I just provide a brief overview here. Here are some examples of alerting rules that can be defined:

.grafana-values.yaml - alertingRules
[.img-medium]
image::grafana-rules-configuration.png[]

Here is an example of an alerting rule for monitoring JVM memory usage:

== Exploring Telemetry in Grafana

Use the Explore tab in Grafana to interactively query metrics, traces, and logs.

Navigate to Data Sources in Grafana to see the provisioned data sources.

=== Metrics Example (JVM Memory Usage)

Click 'Explore' next to the Prometheus data source to run queries and visualize metrics.

PromQL queries can be used to retrieve specific metrics. For example, to monitor JVM memory usage, you can use the following query:

.PromQL
[source,text]
----
(
  sum by(pod) (jvm_memory_used_bytes{jvm_memory_type="heap"})
  /
  sum by(pod) (jvm_memory_limit_bytes{jvm_memory_type="heap"})
) * 100
----

.Grafana UI - Explore Metrics
[.img-wide]
image::grafana-explore-metrics.png[]

This can be added to a Grafana dashboard panel to visualize JVM memory usage over time.

=== Traces Example (Jaeger)

Click 'Explore' next to the Jaeger data source to run queries and visualize traces.

Choose the 'Search' query type and select your application service (e.g., `otel-spring-example`) to view traces. Operation name can be specified to filter traces further.

.Grafana UI - Explore Traces
[.img-wide]
image::grafana-explore-traces.png[]

Click on a trace to drill down into its spans, durations, and metadata.

.Grafana UI - Trace Detail View
[.img-wide]
image::grafana-explore-metrics-details.png[]

=== Logs Example (OpenSearch)

Click 'Explore' next to the OpenSearch data source to run Lucene queries and view logs.

Choose the 'Logs' query type to search logs. You can filter logs by service name, severity level, or other fields.

[text,lucene]
----
serviceName: "otel-spring-example" AND severityText: "ERROR"
----

.Grafana UI - Explore Logs
[.img-wide]
image::grafana-explore-logs.png[]

All detials of the log entry, such as timestamp, severity, message, and service metadata, can be viewed by clicking on any log entry.

== Conclusion

By unifying metrics, traces, and logs into a single Grafana dashboard, you can achieve comprehensive visibility and faster diagnostics across your microservices environment. This centralized observability experience empowers teams to proactively manage system performance and collaborate more effectively.
