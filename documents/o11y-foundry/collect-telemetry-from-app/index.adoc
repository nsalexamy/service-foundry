title: "Collecting Telemetry from On-Premises and Cloud-Based Applications"
summary: "In this article, I walk through how to collect telemetry dataâ€”including logs, metrics, and tracesâ€”from applications running outside of Kubernetes, such as on-premises servers or cloud-hosted environments. Using OpenTelemetry, Docker Compose, and the OpenTelemetry Java Agent, I demonstrate how to set up the collector, instrument a Java application, and view telemetry data locally. This guide extends Kubernetes-native observability practices to external workloads, offering a consistent approach across hybrid environments."

== Overview

This guide demonstrates how to collect telemetryâ€”logs, metrics, and tracesâ€”from applications running in both on-premises environments and cloud-based infrastructure using OpenTelemetry. It covers setup instructions for the OpenTelemetry Collector outside Kubernetes using Docker Compose and shows how to instrument applications for observability.

For Kubernetes-native workloads, refer to the articles below:

* link:https://nsalexamy.github.io/service-foundry/pages/documents/o11y-foundry/jaeger-otel-collector/[Distributed Tracing - Jaeger and OpenTelemetry Collector]

* link:https://nsalexamy.github.io/service-foundry/pages/documents/o11y-foundry/metrics-otel-collector/[Collecting Metrics using OpenTelemetry Collector and Visualizing them using Prometheus and Grafana on Kubernetes]

This guide extends those approaches to applications deployed outside Kubernetes environments.


== OpenTelemetry Components

The primary OpenTelemetry components used in this guide are:

* *OpenTelemetry Collector*: A service for receiving, processing, and exporting telemetry data.
* *OpenTelemetry SDKs and Agents*: Language-specific libraries and instrumentation agents for generating telemetry from applications.

== Deploying the OpenTelemetry Collector via Docker Compose

To simplify the setup, Docker Compose is used to deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector and its dependencies locally without requiring a Kubernetes cluster.


If youâ€™re deploying a full observability stack on Kubernetes, refer to:

* link:https://nsalexamy.github.io/service-foundry/pages/products/observability-foundry/[Observability Foundry]
* link:https://nsalexamy.github.io/service-foundry/pages/documents/blog/observability-in-dev-env/[Deploying Observability Stack in Development Environment]

=== Docker Compose Setup

Create a docker-compose.yaml file with the following content:

.docker-compose.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
version: '3'

services:
  otel-collector:
    image: otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib
    ## <1>
    volumes:
      - ./otel-collector-config.yaml:/etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml
    ports:
      - 1888:1888 # pprof extension
      - 8888:8888 # Prometheus metrics exposed by the Collector
      - 8889:8889 # Prometheus exporter metrics
      - 13133:13133 # health_check extension
      - 4317:4317 # OTLP gRPC receiver
      - 4318:4318 # OTLP http receiver
      - 55679:55679 # zpages extension

----
<1> This mounts the OpenTelemetry Collector configuration file into the container.

=== OpenTelemetry Collector Configuration

This configuration uses a debug exporter to print collected telemetry to the console.

.otel-collector-config.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
processors:
  batch:
    send_batch_size: 10000
    timeout: 10s

exporters:
  debug:
    verbosity: detailed

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [debug]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [debug]
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [debug]
----

=== Start OpenTelemetry Collector

To start the Collector:

[source,terminal]
----
$ docker-compose up
----

Telemetry data will be printed in the terminal when received.


== Instrumenting Applications with OpenTelemetry SDKs

=== Java Application

You can use the following example repository:

https://github.com/nsalexamy/otel-spring-example

=== Java Agent

Download the latest version of the OpenTelemetry Java agent from:

* link:https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/java/agent/getting-started/[Java Agent Getting Started]

You can find the *opentelemetry-javaagent.jar* file in the `otel-spring-example` repository under the *javaagent* directory.

To enable the agent, you can use -javaagent option or JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS environment variable like below.

[source,terminal]
----
$ export JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS="-javaagent:javaagent/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar"
----


=== Configuring Environment Variables

To instrument the Java application with OpenTelemetry, you need to set the following environment variables:

* *OTEL_SERVICE_NAME*: The name of the service that will be reported in the telemetry data.
* *OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT*: The endpoint of the OpenTelemetry Collector to which the telemetry data will be sent.
* *OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER*: The exporter to use for traces. Default is `otlp`.
* *OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER*: The exporter to use for logs. Default is `otlp`.
* *OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER*: The exporter to use for metrics. Default is `otlp`.
* *OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL*: The interval at which metrics will be exported. Default is `60000` milliseconds.
* *OTEL_EXPORTER_PROMETHEUS_PORT*: The port on which the Prometheus exporter will expose metrics. Default is `9464`.

Set the following environment variables to configure the agent:
[source,terminal]
----
$ export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=otel-spring-example
$ export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318
----

=== Running the Application

To run the Java application with OpenTelemetry instrumentation, use the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ ./gradlew clean bootRun
$ java -javaagent:javaagent/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar -jar build/libs/otel-spring-example-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --server.port=8080
----

=== Generating Telemetry Data

* Metrics are automatically exported at intervals using the Java agent.
* Logs are emitted via application logging.
* Traces are generated by sending HTTP requests to the application.

Example:

[source,terminal]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/error/cause/0.3
----

This triggers a trace and logs an error (30% chance of HTTP 500).

== Metrics Exporter Considerations

Use one of the following exporters:

* otlp: Best suited for external or local development environments.
* prometheus: Exposes metrics at /metrics, ideal for use in Kubernetes.

To use the Prometheus exporter:
[source,terminal]
----
$ export OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=prometheus
$ export OTEL_EXPORTER_PROMETHEUS_PORT=9464
----

If you restart the application, you can see the metrics being collected by the OpenTelemetry Collector in the console where it is running.

http://localhost:9464/metrics

The port 9464 is the default port for the OpenTelemetry Collector to expose the Prometheus metrics.


=== OpenTelemetry Environment Variable Specification

Refer to the link below for the complete list of OpenTelemetry environment variables that can be used to configure the OpenTelemetry Java agent:

https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/configuration/sdk-environment-variables/

== Collecting Container Metrics

For container-level metrics, use the OpenTelemetry Collector with the cadvisor receiver. Details:

* https://nsalexamy.github.io/service-foundry/pages/documents/o11y-foundry/metrics-kubelet-cadvisor/[Scraping Container Metrics via Kubelet cAdvisor in Kubernetes]

== Real-World Deployment

In production:
* Deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector in Kubernetes.
* For external applications, expose the Collector using an Ingress or LoadBalancer.
* Set OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT accordingly for external clients.

== Visualizing Telemetry Data in Grafana

Use Grafana to visualize metrics, traces, and logs collected via the OpenTelemetry Collector. This can be integrated with Prometheus, Jaeger, and OpenSearch as telemetry backends.

== Conclusion

This guide provided a practical approach for collecting telemetry from applications deployed outside Kubernetes environments using OpenTelemetry. You learned how to deploy the Collector with Docker Compose, configure a Java application with the OpenTelemetry Java agent, and generate and inspect telemetry data.
