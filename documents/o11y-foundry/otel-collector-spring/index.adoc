=== OpenTelemetry Collector

[.img-wide]

OpenTelemetry Collector is a vendor-agnostic agent for observability data. It is a powerful tool that can be used to collect, process, and export telemetry data. It can be used to collect traces, metrics, and logs from various sources and export them to various destinations.

In this article, we will use OTLP as the receiver and Zipkin as the exporter. OTLP is a protocol that can be used to send telemetry data to the OpenTelemetry Collector. Zipkin is a distributed tracing system that can be used to visualize and analyze traces.

In the previous article, we used OpenTelemetry Instrumentation to export traces to Zipkin directly shown in the following diagram.

In this article, we will use OpenTelemetry Collector to receive traces from OpenTelemetry Instrumentation and export them to Zipkin as shown in the following diagram. If needed, trace data can be processed and transformed before exporting it to Zipkin.

== Install OpenTelemetry Collector and Instrumentation

When installing OpenTelemetry Operator, Some CDRs are created to install OpenTelemetry Collector and Instrumentation.

CDR stands for Custom Resource Definition. It is a Kubernetes API extension that allows you to define custom resources. OpenTelemetry Operator uses CDRs to install OpenTelemetry Collector and Instrumentation.

=== Install OpenTelemetry Collector

.otel-collector.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1beta1

        format: proto


    service:
      pipelines:
        traces:
          receivers: [otlp]
          processors: [filter/ottl, memory_limiter, batch]
          exporters: [zipkin]


----

Please note that the name of the collector is otel instead of otel-collector. This will create a service and a deployment for the OpenTelemetry Collector, both named otel-collector.

Run the following command to install the OpenTelemetry Collector.

[source,shell]
----
$ kubectl apply -f otel-collector.yaml

$ kubectl get all -n nsa2 | grep otel

pod/otel-collector-86b854bdfc-xvxjt                                   1/1     Running   0          26s

deployment.apps/otel-collector                                             1/1     1            1           28s
replicaset.apps/otel-collector-86b854bdfc                                             1         1         1       28s
----

We can find the OpenTelemetry Collector pod, service, and deployment in the nsa2 namespace and their names are prefixed with otel-collector.

Without installing Instrumentation shown in the next section, OpenTelemetry Instrumentation can use the OpenTelemetry Collector as the receiver by setting the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable to the OpenTelemetry Collector's endpoint.


.templates/deployment.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
          env:
            - name: JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS
              value: "-javaagent:/usr/app/javaagent/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar"
            - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
              value: http://otel-collector:4318
            - name: OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER
              value: none
            - name: OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER
              value: none
----

Note that JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS is set to use the OpenTelemetry Java agent. And OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT is set to the OpenTelemetry Collector's HTTP endpoint.

But when there are many applications are up and running, it is better to use Instrumentation to export traces to the OpenTelemetry Collector.

=== Install OpenTelemetry Instrumentation

We are going to install OpenTelemetry Instrumentation using the manifest file shown below. With OpenTelemetry Instrumentation, we can manage the configuration of the OpenTelemetry Java agent in a single place.

.otel-instrumentation.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
# https://opentelemetry.io/docs/kubernetes/operator/automatic/
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1
kind: Instrumentation
metadata:
  name: otel-instrumentation
  namespace: nsa2
spec:
  exporter:
    endpoint: http://otel-collector:4317
  propagators:
    - tracecontext
    - baggage
#    - b3
  sampler:
    type: parentbased_traceidratio
    argument: "1"
#  env:
#    - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
#      value: http://otel-collector:4318
  java:
    env:
      - name: JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS
        value: "-javaagent:/usr/app/javaagent/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar"
      - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
        value: http://otel-collector:4318
      - name: OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER
        value: none
      - name: OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER
        value: none

----

In the manifest file, the default exporter for traces is OTLP. System variables set in java.env section are used to configure the OpenTelemetry Java agent for all Java applications. Using Instrumentation makes it easier to manage the configuration of the OpenTelemetry Java agent.

[source,shell]
----
$ kubectl apply -f otel-instrumentation.yaml
----

Now all OpenTelemetry related configurations can be removed from the deployment manifest file.




== Dockerfile

The Dockerfile for the application is as follows:

[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM openjdk:21-jdk-bullseye
COPY ./nsa2-opentelemetry-example-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar /usr/app/nsa2-opentelemetry-example.jar
COPY ./opentelemetry-javaagent.jar /usr/app/javaagent/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar
WORKDIR /usr/app
EXPOSE 8080


ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-Xshare:off", "-Dotel.javaagent.extensions=/usr/app/javaagent/nsa2-otel-extension-1.0-all.jar", "-jar", "nsa2-opentelemetry-example.jar"]
----

Please note that I do not use "-javaagent" option in the ENTRYPOINT. Instead, I set JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS in the manifest file for OpenTelemetry Instrumentation. This way, Docker images can apply OpenTelemetry instrumentation without changing the Dockerfile.



== Deployment manifest

.templates/deployment.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
# omitted for brevity

          env:
#            - name: JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS
#              value: "-javaagent:/usr/app/javaagent/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar"
#            - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
#              value: http://otel-collector:4318
#            - name: OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER
#              value: none
#            - name: OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER
#              value: none
----

In the deployment manifest file, OpenTelemetry related configurations are removed. The OpenTelemetry Java agent is configured in the OpenTelemetry Instrumentation manifest file.
Only system variables required for the application are set in the deployment manifest file.


== Auto Instrumentation Injection

Please refer to the link below for more information on auto-instrumentation injection.

* https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/blob/main/README.md

To use OpenTelemetry Instrumentation, the following annotation should be set in the deployment manifest file or Helm Chart.
----
sidecar.opentelemetry.io/inject: "true"
instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-java: "true"
----


=== Helm Chart

When using Helm Chart, the following values can be set in the values.yaml file.

.values.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
podAnnotations: {
  sidecar.opentelemetry.io/inject: "true",
  instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-java: "true"
}
----

=== Deployment manifest

When using deployment manifest, the following annotation should be set in the deployment manifest file.

.deployment manifest
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
# omitted for brevity
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        sidecar.opentelemetry.io/inject: "true"
        instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-java: "true"
----

== Conclusion

In this article, we discussed how to set up OpenTelemetry Collector and Instrumentation to export traces to Zipkin. OpenTelemetry Collector is a powerful tool that can be used to collect, process, and export telemetry data. It can be used to collect traces, metrics, and logs from various sources and export them to various destinations.
