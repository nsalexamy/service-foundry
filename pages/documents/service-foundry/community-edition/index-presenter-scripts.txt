Section: What is Service Foundry?

Service Foundry is an Internal Developer Platform, or IDP, that enables teams to provision, deploy, secure, and observe workloads on Kubernetes in just 10 minutes.

Think of Service Foundry as a curated stack of enterprise-grade open-source tools combined with a UI-driven GitOps console. As a self-service platform engineering solution, Service Foundry eliminates the complexity of assembling and integrating multiple tools by providing a pre-configured, production-ready GitOps platform.

And here's the best part: no proprietary subscriptions or additional tools are required. Everything runs on your own Kubernetes cluster using battle-tested open-source components.

Service Foundry integrates popular open-source tools into a cohesive automation system, enabling you to use standardized GitOps patterns to manage infrastructure and application workloads declaratively, collaborate effectively through version-controlled configuration stored in Git, deploy complete application stacks including observability, identity management, and data pipelines, secure resources using enterprise-grade Single Sign-On and encrypted secrets management, and accelerate deployment with a curated Application Catalog of ready-to-use open-source applications.

It bridges the gap between developers and operations by providing an intuitive UI-driven console while preserving the auditable, declarative nature of Git-based infrastructure as code.

Section: Internal Developer Platform

So what exactly is an Internal Developer Platform, or IDP?

Service Foundry is an IDP, which is a curated set of tools, services, and automated processes that enable developers to manage the entire application lifecycle independently, without needing deep expertise in Kubernetes, cloud infrastructure, or security internals.

Let me explain the problem that an IDP solves. Without an IDP, developers face several bottlenecks. First, there's what we call "TicketOps"—waiting days for infrastructure teams to provision databases, open firewall ports, or grant permissions. Second, there's complexity overload: needing to master Kubernetes, cloud APIs, networking, and security just to deploy a simple service. Third, inconsistent practices: every team builds infrastructure differently, leading to maintenance nightmares. And fourth, manual deployments: error-prone manual steps that cause that infamous "works on my machine" syndrome.

An IDP removes these bottlenecks by providing self-service capabilities, standardized workflows, and automated operations.

Section: The Five Planes of an IDP

Modern IDPs are structured into five technical planes that handle different aspects of the platform. Let me walk you through each one.

First, the Developer Control Plane. This is the primary interface, whether it's a web console, command-line interface, or API, where developers interact with the platform to create services, deploy applications, and manage environments.

Second, the Integration and Delivery Plane. This automates the build, test, and deployment pipeline using CI/CD tools like ArgoCD, GitHub Actions, and Argo Rollouts to implement GitOps workflows.

Third, the Resource Plane. This is the underlying infrastructure—Kubernetes clusters, databases, storage, networking—all abstracted away from developers through tools like Terraform and Crossplane.

Fourth, the Security Plane. This manages identity, authentication, authorization using RBAC, and secrets using tools like Keycloak, oh-auth-two Proxy, and Sealed Secrets.

And fifth, the Observability Plane. This monitors platform and application health through integrated logging, metrics, and tracing using OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki.

Service Foundry implements all five planes out of the box, providing a complete, production-ready IDP experience.

Section: Key Features

Service Foundry provides enterprise-grade capabilities out of the box. Let me highlight some of the key features.

First, auditable Infrastructure as Code. All configuration changes are tracked in Git, providing full audit trails and rollback capabilities.

Second, standardized GitOps patterns. You can implement industry best practices for continuous deployment and infrastructure management.

Third, version-controlled configuration. Manage all platform and application configurations through Git workflows.

Fourth, complete application stacks. Deploy entire technology stacks—observability, identity, data pipelines—with pre-configured integrations.

Fifth, enterprise security. Built-in Single Sign-On and encrypted secrets management using Keycloak and Sealed Secrets.

And sixth, automated certificate management. Automatic TLS certificate provisioning and renewal via cert-manager.

Section: Main Components

Service Foundry is built on a curated stack of proven open-source tools, carefully integrated to work seamlessly together. These components map directly to the five IDP planes that we discussed earlier.

Let me start with the Developer Control Plane. This includes the Service Foundry Console, which is a UI-driven GitOps console providing visual management of applications, deployments, and platform configurations.

For the Integration and Delivery Plane, we have ArgoCD, which is a GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes, providing declarative application deployment and lifecycle management. We also have Argo Rollouts for advanced deployment strategies including blue-green, canary, and progressive delivery with automated rollbacks. And we have the Service Foundry Builder, which is a GitOps resource generator that creates and updates Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts.

The Resource Plane includes Traefik, a modern cloud-native ingress controller with Gateway API support for routing external traffic to services. We also have PostgreSQL for relational database storage and Redis for in-memory data storage and caching.

For the Security Plane, we have Keycloak for enterprise-grade Identity and Access Management. We have oh-auth-two Proxy, which is a secure Single Sign-On integration layer that protects applications with authentication. We have Sealed Secrets for encrypted secrets management, allowing safe storage of sensitive data in Git repositories. And we have cert-manager for automated TLS certificate provisioning and renewal.

Finally, the Observability Plane includes a comprehensive stack. The observability stack is optional but highly recommended for production environments. All observability components can be easily installed through the Service Foundry Console UI. This includes OpenTelemetry, a vendor-neutral observability framework for collecting traces, metrics, and logs. Prometheus for industry-standard metrics collection and storage. Grafana for feature-rich observability dashboards. Jaeger for distributed tracing. OpenSearch for scalable search and analytics. Fluent Bit for lightweight log collection. Loki for horizontally scalable log aggregation. And Tempo for cost-effective distributed tracing.

Section: Community Edition

Service Foundry Community Edition is a free, open-source version that provides full access to all platform features with no proprietary subscriptions required.

All examples in our technical videos are implemented using Service Foundry Community Edition.

Section: What You Need to Run Service Foundry

Service Foundry has minimal requirements and can be deployed in just 10 minutes with the following prerequisites.

For infrastructure, you need a Kubernetes Cluster, specifically AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service, or EKS. This version of Service Foundry has been tested and is currently supported only on Amazon Web Services using EKS. You'll need Kubernetes version 1.24 or higher. Additional cloud providers like GKE and AKS, as well as self-managed Kubernetes distributions, will be supported in future releases.

You'll also need a Git repository for storing GitOps configurations. This can be GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or any Git provider.

The Service Foundry Bootstrap tool automates the entire installation process. First, it performs the initial setup by installing ArgoCD as the GitOps engine on your Kubernetes cluster. Second, it deploys core components using ArgoCD to deploy all core components from your GitOps repository. Third, it sets up GitOps configuration by creating the necessary repository structure and manifests. And fourth, it activates the console by deploying the Service Foundry Console UI.

All core components are version-controlled in the GitOps repository, allowing you to track all changes through Git commit history, review and approve infrastructure changes via pull requests, update components using standard GitOps workflows, roll back to previous configurations when needed, and maintain consistency across multiple environments.

Section: Service Foundry Profiles

Service Foundry Profiles are pre-configured, production-ready stacks of integrated open-source tools designed for specific use cases. Each profile includes tested configurations, best practices, and documentation to accelerate your platform adoption.

Let me walk you through the available profiles.

First, the GitOps Profile. This includes pre-configured ArgoCD and Argo Rollouts with multi-environment deployment pipelines for dev, staging, and production, automated promotion workflows, and rollback and progressive delivery strategies.

Second, the Application Catalog Profile. This is a curated collection of popular open-source applications including databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis, message queues like RabbitMQ and Kafka, caching solutions like Redis and Memcached, and development tools like GitLab and Jenkins.

Third, the Observability Profile. This is a complete observability stack with pre-configured integrations between OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, OpenSearch, Fluent Bit, Loki, and Tempo, plus pre-built dashboards and alerting rules.

Fourth, the Security and SSO Profile. This enterprise security stack features Keycloak identity management with user federation, oh-auth-two Proxy for application protection, Traefik Gateway API for secure ingress, and Sealed Secrets for encrypted credentials.

And fifth, the Data Pipelines Profile. This data engineering and processing stack includes Apache Airflow for workflow orchestration, Apache Spark for distributed data processing, Apache Kafka for event streaming, Neo4j graph database, PostgreSQL for data warehousing, and Redis for data caching.

Each profile is designed to work standalone or in combination, allowing you to build a complete platform tailored to your team's needs.

Section: Who is Service Foundry For?

Service Foundry is designed for teams and organizations looking to adopt GitOps practices on Kubernetes without the overhead of assembling and integrating multiple tools.

Here are some ideal use cases. Platform Engineering Teams can build internal developer platforms with standardized workflows and self-service capabilities. Startups and Scale-ups can establish production-grade infrastructure quickly without dedicating extensive resources to platform development. Educational Institutions can provide students and researchers with a complete, enterprise-grade technology stack for learning modern DevOps practices. Innovation and PoC Teams can rapidly prototype and validate new technologies on Kubernetes. Enterprise Development Teams can standardize application deployment pipelines across multiple teams and projects. And DevOps Practitioners can implement GitOps best practices with proven patterns and tools without starting from scratch.

Section: Best Practices

To maximize the value of Service Foundry, we recommend the following practices.

First, version control everything. Store all configuration for platform components and enterprise applications in Git repositories with proper version control.

Second, implement automated promotion pipelines. Establish progressive delivery workflows across environments from PR to Development to Staging to Production with automated testing gates.

Third, enforce authentication. Use SSO, or Single Sign-On, for all platform and application access to maintain centralized identity management.

Fourth, secure sensitive data. Store all secrets using Sealed Secrets or external secret managers, never committing plain-text credentials to Git.

Fifth, use Gateway API. Leverage Traefik's Gateway API implementation for standardized, secure external access to services.

Sixth, enable observability. Deploy the observability stack in all non-development environments to maintain visibility into system health and performance.

Seventh, perform regular updates. Keep platform components updated through GitOps workflows, testing updates in lower environments before production.

And eighth, document custom configurations. Maintain documentation for any customizations or extensions to Service Foundry profiles in your GitOps repository.
